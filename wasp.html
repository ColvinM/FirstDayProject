                    <p>The Wasp (Janet van Dyne) is a character appearing in American comic books published by Marvel
                        Comics. Created by Stan Lee, Ernie Hart, and Jack Kirby, the character first appeared in Tales
                        to
                        Astonish #44 (June 1963).</p>

                    <p>Janet van Dyne is usually depicted as having the ability to shrink to a height of several
                        centimeters, fly by means of insectoid wings, and fire bioelectric energy blasts. She is a
                        founding
                        member of the Avengers and the one who gave them their name as well as a longtime leader of the
                        team. She is also the ex-wife of Hank Pym and the stepmother of Nadia van Dyne.</p>

                    <p>The Wasp has been described as one of Marvel's most notable and powerful female heroes.
                        The character appears in the Marvel Cinematic Universe film Ant-Man (2015) in a cameo role,
                        portrayed by Hayley Lovitt, while Michelle Pfeiffer portrays Janet van Dyne in the films Ant-Man
                        and
                        the Wasp (2018), Avengers: Endgame (2019), and Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania (2023). An
                        original
                        MCU Wasp, Janet's daughter Hope van Dyne (named after Hope Pym), is portrayed in each film by
                        Evangeline Lilly.</p>

                    <p>Janet van Dyne debuted in Tales to Astonish #44 (plotted by Stan Lee, scripted by H. E. Huntley,
                        and
                        drawn by Jack Kirby, June 1963) as Henry "Hank" Pym's partner, becoming the Wasp to avenge the
                        death
                        of her father, scientist Vernon van Dyne.[6] She co-starred in Tales to Astonish from issue #44
                        to
                        issue #69 (1963–65). She was also the star of her own backup feature in issues #51–58 (1964).
                    </p>

                    <p>She was a founding member of the Avengers, appearing in the first issue and giving the team its
                        name. It is with the Avengers that Janet became most well known. At first she was the weak link
                        of
                        the team, but later on became one of the smartest and craftiest of its members. Though she takes
                        leaves of absence throughout the series, she is one of the longest active members and has acted
                        as
                        leader of the team for longer than anybody besides Captain America.
                        During her absences from the core Avengers book, Janet appeared in various other publications,
                        including appearing as a main character in Marvel Feature issues #6–10 (1972–73). She has also
                        made
                        sporadic guest appearances in various other books, such as Captain America, Iron Man, and
                        Fantastic
                        Four.</p>

                    <p>Janet became the leader of the Avengers in The Avengers #217 (1982), a position she held until
                        #278
                        (1987), with the exception of a brief period where she handed leadership off to the Vision. She
                        then
                        appeared in issue #32 of West Coast Avengers (May 1988), becoming a full-time member in issue
                        #42.</p>

                    <p>She made occasional appearances in Avengers vol. 3, returning as an active member of the team in
                        issue #27 (2000) before resuming leadership duties. She and Captain America became co-leaders of
                        the
                        team starting in issue #38.</p>
